Flip Book

The final project in my Mobile Apps course was pretty open ended. The only requirement was to create an app with significant features. 

I used Android Studio to create the app here, flip book, which allows the user to draw and play short, simple animations, and even export said animations to their device as videos. 

There is a very limiting drawback to this app, where the app fails to allocate 
memory if the user tries to make their animation too long. To prevent this from crashing the app, the animations are limited to 32 frames, which is four seconds of animation. I'm currently looking for a way to fix this issue.
